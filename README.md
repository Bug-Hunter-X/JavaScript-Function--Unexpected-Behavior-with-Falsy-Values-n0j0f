# JavaScript Function: Unexpected Behavior with Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving how functions handle falsy values.  The initial `foo` function correctly handles `null` inputs, but it fails to account for other falsy values (0, false, '', etc.).

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for these falsy values.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the conditional statement within the `foo` function.  While it correctly checks for `null`, it does not consider values that evaluate to `false` in a boolean context.  This can lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves expanding the conditional statement to include checks for falsy values beyond `null`.  The corrected function now provides robust handling for a broader range of inputs.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the problematic function.
3. Run the code to observe the incorrect behavior with falsy values.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` for the solution and verify the improved handling of falsy values.
